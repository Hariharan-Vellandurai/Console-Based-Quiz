# QUIZ  GAMING--JAVA APPLICATION
# OVERVIEW 
**üéÆ Welcome to the Quiz Gaming Application!**

This repository contains a simple console-based quiz game implemented in Java using NetBeans IDE 20. The program allows users to take a quiz consisting of multiple-choice questions with a timer for each question. The quiz questions, options, correct answers, and time limit per question are defined within the code.

* **Question Display:** The quiz presents one question at a time along with multiple-choice options for the user to select from.

* **Answer Submission:** Users can select an option and submit their answers within the given time limit.

* **Score Calculation:** The program keeps track of the user's score based on correct answers.
